# Backup Guide for RNG Arena

## Current Backup System
Git is now initialized for this project. You can create backups and revert changes as needed.

## Creating a Backup
Before making major changes, create a backup:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Backup: [Description of current state]"
```

## Viewing Backups
```bash
git log --oneline
```

## Reverting to a Previous Backup
```bash
git reset --hard [commit-hash]
```

## Current Working State (Backup #1)
- Tab-style nameplates at bottom with golden styling
- VS display with black background in center
- Tournament progress bar at top center (bigger size)
- HP display system under hero nameplate
- Chest fade transitions on upgrade
- Complete battle and tournament system
- Mobile-responsive design

## Quick Backup Commands
```bash
# Quick backup
git add . && git commit -m "Backup: [your description]"

# See recent commits
git log --oneline -5

# Emergency revert (be careful!)
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
