# RNG Arena - Development Notes

## âš¡ STARTUP PROCESS - RUN THIS IMMEDIATELY WHEN ASKED

When the user says "run the startup process", "launch RNG Arena", or "start the server":

```bash
npm start
```

That's it! This runs Vite dev server on port 8000 with hot reload.

Server will be available at: http://localhost:8000

## Development Commands

### Standard Commands (Professional)
```bash
npm start          # Start dev server (Vite)
npm run build      # Build for production
npm run preview    # Preview production build
npm run lint       # Run ESLint
npm run format     # Run Prettier
```

### Troubleshooting

#### Port Already in Use
If port 8000 is occupied:

**Diagnosis:**
```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :8000
```

**Fix:**
```bash
taskkill -F -PID [process_id]
npm start
```

#### Manual Server (Fallback)
If npm start fails, use http-server as fallback:
```bash
npx http-server -p 8000 .
```

**CRITICAL:** Must include `.` at end to serve from root, NOT from `./public`
