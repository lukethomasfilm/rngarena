# RNG Arena - Changes Log

## Overview
This document tracks all changes made to fix the start button and tournament bracket issues.

## Original Issues
- Start button wasn't working
- Tournament bracket was missing
- HTML file had corrupted content at the beginning

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed HTML Corruption
**File:** `index.html`
**Change:** Removed corrupted text from line 1
**Before:** `make sure it works superi think what h<!DOCTYPE html>`
**After:** `<!DOCTYPE html>`

### 2. Script Loading Fixes
**Files:** `index.html`, `public/script.js`, `public/tournament.js`

**Changes:**
- Copied `script.js` from root to `public/script.js`
- Copied `tournament.js` from root to `public/tournament.js`
- Updated HTML script references from `./script.js` to `/script.js`
- Updated HTML script references from `./tournament.js` to `/tournament.js`

**Reason:** Vite build process was trying to bundle the scripts but they weren't being processed correctly, causing 404 errors.

### 3. Attempted Modular System Migration (REVERTED)
**Files:** `index.html`, `js/RNGArena.js`

**What we tried:**
- Switched from `script.js` to modular `js/RNGArena.js` system
- Added ES6 module imports
- Fixed duplicate variable declarations in `js/RNGArena.js`

**Why we reverted:**
- The modular system expected different DOM elements that didn't exist in the HTML
- Caused layout to break (missing buttons, messed up loot tier display)
- Reverted back to original working system

### 4. Build Process Fixes
**Command:** `npm run build`
**Result:** Successfully built project with all scripts properly included in dist folder

## Current Working State

### Files Modified:
1. `index.html` - Fixed corruption and script paths
2. `public/script.js` - Copied from root for proper serving
3. `public/tournament.js` - Copied from root for proper serving
4. `js/RNGArena.js` - Fixed duplicate variable declarations (but not currently used)

### Files NOT Modified:
- `script.js` (original in root - still intact)
- `tournament.js` (original in root - still intact)
- `styles.css` - No changes made
- All image files - No changes made
- `package.json` - No changes made

## How to Revert Everything

### Option 1: Git Revert (if using git)
```bash
git checkout HEAD -- index.html
rm public/script.js public/tournament.js
```

### Option 2: Manual Revert
1. **Restore index.html:**
   - Change script src back to `./script.js` and `./tournament.js`
   - Add back the corrupted text if needed: `make sure it works superi think what h<!DOCTYPE html>`

2. **Remove copied files:**
   - Delete `public/script.js`
   - Delete `public/tournament.js`

3. **Rebuild:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## What's Working Now
- ✅ Start button functions properly
- ✅ Tournament bracket displays correctly
- ✅ All UI elements (emoji buttons, loot tier) are visible
- ✅ No JavaScript console errors
- ✅ Scripts load without 404 errors

## Notes
- The original `script.js` and `tournament.js` files in the root directory are untouched
- The modular system in `js/RNGArena.js` exists but is not currently used
- All changes are minimal and easily reversible
- The build process now works correctly with the current setup

## Date: December 2024
## Status: All issues resolved, game fully functional

## Session 2 - Combat Speed, HP Balancing, Audio Fix, and 3-Pose System
**Date:** January 2025

### Changes Made

#### 1. Fixed Audio File Naming Issues
**Problem:** Audio files had `#` characters in filenames which caused URL loading issues in live mode.

**Files Modified:**
- `js/CombatSystem.js` - Updated all audio file paths to remove `%23` URL encoding
- `js/RNGArena.js` - Updated fight entrance sounds and special round sounds
- Renamed 33 audio files across `sfx/` and `public/sfx/` directories

**Changes:**
- Removed `#` characters from all audio filenames
- Removed `!` and `,` characters for consistency
- Cleaned up double underscores `__` to single `_`
- Examples:
  - `Fight!_fighter_game__#1` → `Fight_fighter_game_1`
  - `sword_strike_on_meta_#2` → `sword_strike_on_meta_2`
  - `Rest_now,_fighter_fi_#1` → `Rest_now_fighter_fi_1`

#### 2. Combat Speed Improvements
**Problem:** Combat felt slow with too many pauses between attacks and defenses.

**File:** `js/CombatSystem.js`

**Changes:**
- Reduced main attack-to-defense delay: 800ms → 200ms (line 327)
- Removed block/parry response delays: 500ms → instant (lines 283, 291, 302)
- Reduced hit damage delay: 800ms → 100ms (line 470)
- Reduced parry reflection delay: 800ms → 100ms (line 430)
- Reduced animation duration: 1000ms → 400ms (line 510)

**Result:** Combat is now 4-5x faster and more responsive while maintaining visual clarity.

#### 3. HP Balancing
**Problem:** With faster combat, fights ended too quickly.

**File:** `js/constants.js`

**Changes - HP Doubled Across All Rounds:**
- Rounds 1-2: 5 HP → 10 HP
- Rounds 3-4: 8 HP → 16 HP
- Rounds 5-6: 12 HP → 24 HP
- Rounds 7-9 (Quarterfinals/Semifinals/Finals): 20 HP → 40 HP

**Result:** Fight duration remains similar to before, but combat feels much snappier.

#### 4. Implemented 3-Pose Fighter System
**Problem:** Fighters only had one static sprite, making combat look static.

**Files Modified:**
- `js/constants.js` - Added hero pose constants
- `js/RNGArena.js` - Added pose switching logic
- `js/CombatSystem.js` - Integrated pose changes with combat animations

**New Images Added:**
- `images/Characters/daring_hero_ready.png` - Default/idle pose
- `images/Characters/daring_hero_attack.png` - Attack/parry pose
- `images/Characters/daring_hero_defense.png` - Defense/block pose

**Old Files Deleted:**
- `images/Characters/Daring_hero.png`
- `public/images/Characters/Daring_hero.png`
- `dist/images/Characters/Daring_hero.png`

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Constants (js/constants.js)
HERO_READY: 'daring_hero_ready.png'
HERO_ATTACK: 'daring_hero_attack.png'
HERO_DEFENSE: 'daring_hero_defense.png'

// Pose switching logic (js/RNGArena.js)
getCharacterImage(characterName, pose = 'ready')
updateFighterPose(fighterElement, characterName, pose)

// Automatic pose changes in combat (js/CombatSystem.js)
addCombatAnimation() - Now switches poses based on action
```

**How It Works:**
- **Idle/Ready:** Shows ready pose by default
- **Attacking/Parrying:** Switches to attack pose during animation
- **Defending/Blocking:** Switches to defense pose during animation
- **Auto-Reset:** Returns to ready pose after each action (400ms)

**Extensibility:** System designed to easily add pose support for other fighters (knights) in the future.

#### 5. Loot Claim Visual Update
**Problem:** After claiming loot, the chest disappeared leaving empty space.

**File:** `js/RNGArena.js` (lines 265-279)

**Change:** When loot claim popup closes, the left sidebar chest is replaced with the glowing helmet instead of hiding entirely.

**Result:**
- Chest → Click to claim → Popup opens → Click chest in popup → Helmet appears
- Close popup → Glowing helmet now displayed in left panel
- Uses same animations as popup (wiggle + glow effects)

### Technical Details

**Audio Files Affected:** 33 total files renamed
- 17 files in `sfx/`
- 16 files in `public/sfx/`

**Animation Timing Breakdown:**
```javascript
// Old timings
Attack-to-defense: 800ms
Block/Parry delay: 500ms
Hit delay: 800ms
Animation duration: 1000ms

// New timings
Attack-to-defense: 200ms
Block/Parry delay: 0ms (instant)
Hit delay: 100ms
Animation duration: 400ms
```

**HP Scaling Formula:**
```
Rounds 1-2: 10 HP (2x)
Rounds 3-4: 16 HP (2x)
Rounds 5-6: 24 HP (2x)
Rounds 7-9: 40 HP (2x)
```

### Files Modified Summary
1. `js/CombatSystem.js` - Audio paths, combat timing, pose integration
2. `js/RNGArena.js` - Audio paths, pose system, loot display
3. `js/constants.js` - HP values, hero pose constants
4. `index.html` - (minor updates)
5. `styles.css` - (minor updates)

### What's Working Now
- ✅ All audio files load correctly in live mode
- ✅ Combat is fast and responsive
- ✅ HP is balanced for new combat speed
- ✅ Daring Hero uses 3-pose animation system
- ✅ Loot chest shows glowing helmet after claiming
- ✅ All visual effects and sounds properly synchronized

## Status: Production Ready
**Date:** January 2025
